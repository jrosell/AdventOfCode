## AdventOfCode

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

I don't expect to be able to complete each solution every day, but I will try to save all my solutions here.

I don't have any rules I follow, but I I will end up doing most solutions using R and tidyverse for the fun of doing it.
