## Part 1: Find the signal strength during the 20th, 60th, 100th, 140th, 180th, and 220th cycles. What is the sum of these six signal strengths?

I manually downloaded my personal [day 9 input file](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/10) as a logged user, and here I get the data in a more appropriate shape.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
file <- here::here("2022/10_input")

data <- file %>%
  read_csv(col_names = "x", show_col_types = FALSE) %>% 
  pull() %>%
  str_split(" ") %>%
  unlist() %>% 
  as.integer() %>% 
  replace_na(0) 
data
```

Here the result:

```{r}
begin <- 1
result <- cumsum(c(begin, data))
sum(result[seq(20,220,40)]*seq(20,220,40))

```
