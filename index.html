<h1>AdventOfCode<h1>

<p>[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.</p>

<p>I don't expect to be able to complete each solution every day, but I will try to save all my solutions here.</p>

<p>I don't have any rules I follow, but I I will end up doing most solutions using R and tidyverse for the fun of doing it.</p>
